App::Midgen
==========

Generate the 'requires' and 'test requires' for Makefile.PL using Module::Install::DSL

This started out as a way of generating the core for a Module::Install::DSL Makefile.PL, 
why DSL because it's nice and clean, so now I can generate the contents when I want, 
rather than as I add new use and require statments, and because adam kicked me :)
